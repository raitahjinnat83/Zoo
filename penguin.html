            <p>
                Penguins, despite being birds, lack the ability to fly and 
                instead move by waddling upright. They utilize their flippers 
                for swimming through aquatic environments. Remarkably, penguins 
                are among the select few animal species known to form lifelong 
                bonds with their mates. Their diet encompasses shrimp, fish, 
                crabs, and squid. Primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, 
                including regions like Australia and Antarctica, penguins 
                typically have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years in their natural 
                habitat.

                As the largest land mammal, elephants use their trunks 
                for many purposes, such as sucking up water to hydrate. 
                They also have tusks they use for self-defense and to gather food.
                However, the illegal ivory trade targets elephants for their 
                tusks, which is why their conservation status is volatile and 
                endangered. Elephants are herbivores which mainly eat grass and 
                fruit. They are highly intelligent and usually peaceful animals, 
                found across diverse habitats such as the forest and desert 
                across countries in both the continents Africa and Asia. 
                Asian elephants have a shorter lifespan of around 50 years 
                than African elephants, which can live up to 60 to 70 years.

                Polar bears, the largest species of bear globally, 
                primarily inhabit the sea ice regions of the ocean. 
                As apex predators, they devote much of their time to hunting 
                for sustenance. Their diet primarily comprises seals, which 
                provide the necessary fat reserves for thermal insulation. 
                Additionally, polar bears exhibit remarkable swimming abilities, 
                capable of maintaining a speed of six miles per hour. 
                In the wild, they typically live for about 25 to 30 years.
                However, their conservation status is currently deemed 
                vulnerable.

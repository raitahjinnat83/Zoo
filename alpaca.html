                Alpacas, when domesticated, have a lifespan of about 15 to 20 years. 
                While related to llamas as members of the camel family, 
                alpacas are smaller lamoids with rounded bodies. They are herbivores,
                so their diet consists of grass and woody shrubs. Alpacas are native 
                to South America, specifically the Andes Mountains. These animals 
                are additionally raised for highly valued fleece, which enables 
                them to survive colder climates. Alpacas behave in herds and 
                generally have a gentle and non-aggressive temperament.

        <h1>Welcome to Raitah's Zoo!</h1>
        <p1>
            Hello! 
            Enjoy your journey through our virtual zoo. 
            Embark on a wonderful adventure to learn more about 
            the majesties of the animal kingdom. 
            Learning about these lovely creatures matters for our 
            understanding of the Earth and therefore how to care 
            for it in harmonious coexistence.
